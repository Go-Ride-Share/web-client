# Go-Ride-Share/Web-Client

## Local Setup
1. Have teh API and DB working locally.
1. Copy the env file: `cp .env.example .env` and add env variables.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`. This may require logging into the npm registry. See [here](https://priceline.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PIPE/pages/7900594947/Artifact+Registry+Setup+-+NPM).
1. Run the application `npm start`.

## Deploy
1. This application will be automatically deployed when a PR is merged to main.

## ESLint
A production build requires there to be 0 eslint warnings. One way to resolve them is by using VScode and installing and enabling the Microsoft eslint extension. If setup properly, it will format the files with ESLint on save.

To troubleshoot, you can open the Output console at the bottom of the screen and select ESLint from the dropdown menu. Then press CMD+Shift+P and choose `Format Document With...` and then `ESLint`. It will either format the file or give you something you can debug in the output log.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
